**_CHAPTER 1_**

          **INTRODUCTION**

1.1 PROLOGUE
============

One of the main factors, which contributed to green revolution  in the country during the post-independence period   was water resources projects, both for hydro power and irrigation. However, like any other developmental  activity, the water resources projects have  certain environmental impacts, both  harmful and beneficial.  The environmental effects of water resources projects are being experienced and observed carefully in many developed as well as developing countries.  A need has also been felt to adopt various measures for minimising their negative effects while maximising the benefits.  The objective of environmental impact assessment is to assess both the positive and negative impacts of a project so that necessary environmental management measures can be adopted, wherever necessary, to minimise the adverse impacts.

**1.2 WHAT  IS  ENVIRONMENT ?**

Simply stated, the environment can be defined as one's surroundings. However, a more specific definition is needed to appreciate the issues involved.  The Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 states that "environment includes water, air and land and the inter-relationship which exists among and between water, air and land, and human beings, other living creatures, plants, micro-organisms and property".  In the context of river valley projects the overall environment of the project area is a matter of concern.  

**1.3 WHAT IS SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT?**

 Sustainable development has many connotations. However, the most common definition is the one given in the report of World Commission on Environment and Development viz. \\93Our Common Future\\94 x where \\93Sustainable development is defined as development that meets the needs of the present generation without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs\\94.

**1.4 WATER AND ENVIRONMENT**

Water is a major component of that environment in which man occupies the centre-stage. Apart from the need for drinking, water is needed for producing food and fibre; in process industries and manufacturing and to produce energy \\96 hydro, thermal and nuclear. This great need for water has brought into focus the fragility of environment associated with fulfillment of these needs and the need to guard against it. All great civilizations had grown around water and many had perished with or without water, perhaps not having realised the importance of its sustainable development.

The status of water in the environment is unique. Ever since the birth of earth, from day one, the need for water is always on the increase, not just because of increase in human population but because all living beings are multiplying at a fast rate. The increase in demand has brought tremendous pressure on resource development. This has tended to disturb the status of water in the overall environment. The disturbance, if not contained, may seriously impair the capacity of the resource to meet the demands of future generations and the present civilization may have to go the same way as its predecessors. Hence the need for sustainable development of water resources.

**1.5 ENVIRONMENTAL AWARENESS IN INDIA**

A good environmental sense has been one of the fundamental features of India\\92s ancient philosophy. The earth was called \\93mother earth\\94 and water, air and sun were considered to be gods. Major rivers like the Ganga and the Yamuna were also treated as mothers. The environmental concerns were integrated into various religious and social customs is such a manner that these were automatically taken care of by the people.

**1.6 LEGAL FRAMEWORK**

Adequate provisions for protection of environment and forest are made in the Constitution of India. Article 47 provides for protection and improvement of health. Article 48A is directed towards protection and improvement of environment and protection of forest and wildlife. Article 51 (A) says it is the duty of every citizen to protect and improve natural environment. Following the UN Conference on Human Environment (Stockholm, 1972), a constitutional amendment ( 42, 1976) inserted relevant provisions for environment protection in Constitution in Part IV-Directive Principles and Part IV A- Fundamental Duties.

**1.7 ENVIRONMENTAL ACTS**

In order to ensure sustainable development from water resources angle the Government of India have enacted various Acts and Legislations. Prominent among these is the Environment Protection Act, 1986 through which the Government has acquired wide powers for protecting the environment. Some other Acts related to Water and Environment are Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 (amended in 1988), Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) (Cess) Act. 1977 (amended in 1991), Forest Conservation Act, 1980, Environmental Impact Assessment Notification of 1994 (amended in 1997 and later superceded by EIA Notification of September, 2006), the Ministry of Environment and  Forest\\92s Notification of Jan. 1997, constituting the Central Ground Water Authority,  Biological Diversity Act, 2002 and Wildlife Protection Act, 1972.     

The Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 seeks to maintain or restore \\93wholesomeness of Water\\94 and the Central and state Pollution Control Boards have been established under this Act. According to the Water Cess Act, 1997, both Central and State Governments have to provide funds to the Boards for implementing this act. The Forest Conservation Act, 1980 provides for compensatory afforestation to make up for the diversion of forest land to non-forest use. The Environment Protection Act, 1986 was enacted in 1986 for the protection and improvement of human environment. The EIA Notification of 1994 made the environmental clearance mandatory for all new projects and expansion/modernisation of existing projects covering 29 disciplines (later increased to 32 ) which included hydro-power, major irrigation and flood control projects. Its amendment in 1997 made it mandatory to hold environmental public hearing before according the environmental clearance. It was later superceded by  EIA Notification of September, 2006 (Annexure I) which is described subsequently in Chapter 3.

**1.8 Need for the Guidance Manual**

With a view to improve the environmental clearance (EC) process and compliance therewith, MoEF, GOI, initiated a project with the assistance from the World Bank.  As part of this exercise, MoEF  identified five components of tasks and Component B namely \\93DEVELOP A NATIONAL GUIDANCE MANUAL ON EIA PRACTICE WITH SUPPORT MANUALS ON SELECT DEVELOPMENTAL PROJECTS FOR ENHANCING THE QUALITY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF INDIAN EIAs\\94 was awarded to National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI), Nagpur.

The major objective of this project was to develop a National EIA Guidance Manual on EIA Practice -, addressing select developmental projects to improve the quality and effectiveness of EIA reports/Environmental Management Plans (EMP) / Risk Assessment (RA) / Disaster Management Plan (DMP) presently prepared in India during the Environmental Clearance (EC) process.  The National EIA Guidance Manual will provide technical guidance to project proponents and EIA consultants across all developmental projects to produce quality outputs (such as EIA/EMP/RA/DMP reports) at various steps of the Environmental Clearance Process.

However, NEERI prepared a document  \\93Manual of EIA Practice for Hydroelectric Projects\\94.  This was examined by Members of the Environmental Appraisal Committee(EAC) for River Valley Projects.  The CWC opined that the manual may be modified and renamed as \\93Guidance Manual \\96 Environmental Impact Assessment of River Valley Projects\\94 to cover various river valley projects viz; irrigation, hydropower, flood control and multipurpose which are dealt by the EAC and also gave various suggestions for its improvement.   It was, therefore, decided by the EAC that CWC may prepare a composite EIA Manual both for irrigation and hydroelectric projects.  The present manual has therefore been entitled \\93EIA and Environmental Clearance of River Valley Projects\\94 and relevant extracts/ contents have been taken from the manual prepared by NEERI.

 **1.9 CONTENTS OF MANUAL**

The Manual includes the following contents to provide guidance for conducting EIA and preparation of management plans in an effective manner xx:

\\B7        Environmental  impact assessment

*   Environmental clearance
*   Environmental impacts and their assessment
*    Baseline environmental status
*   Prediction  of impacts
*   Environmental management plans

**_Chapter 2_**

**ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT**

**2.1 WHAT IS EIA ?**

EIA is an "anticipatory, participatory, integrative environmental management tool which has the ultimate objective of providing decision makers with an indication of the likely consequences of their decisions relating to new projects or new programmes, plans or policies."

EIA helps the decision makers to identify the likely effects at an early stage and to improve the quality of project planning and decision making.  It is a process used to predict the environmental consequences of proposed major development projects, to identify and plan for appropriate measures to reduce adverse impacts. 

An EIA attempts to answer the following  questions

1)                  What will happen as a result of the project?

2)                  What will be the extent of the changes ?

3)                  Do the changes matter ?

4)                  What can be done about them ?

5)                  How can decision makers be informed of what needs to be done ?

which could be achieved  through the following  steps:

1)                  Identification of impacts.

2)                  Prediction of significance of causes and effects of impacts

3)                  Evaluation of the predicted adverse impacts to determine whether they are significant enough to warrant mitigation

4)                  Suggesting a wide range of measures to prevent, reduce or remedy those adverse impacts which warrant mitigation

5)                  Documentation of the  process and conclusion.

2.2 NEED FOR EIA
================

It is  necessary to  know about the possible impacts of any developmental plan x on our environment.  Fortunately, adequate legislation could be brought into force to make proper assessment of all such environmental impacts.  The objectives of Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) is to ensure that development is sustained with minimal environmental degradation.  EIA refers to the evaluation of the effects of a major projects on a man-made natural environment.  It is the basic tool for the sound assessment of development proposal.

EIA was introduced in the USA following the enactment of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) by the United States Congress in 1969.  Since then, many countries have included EIA in their environmental legislation.  Over the time,  EIA has evolved as a management tool and a planning aid that helps in identifying, predicting, assessing impacts on environment from proposed development projects.  It is a valuable mechanism that aids in promoting sustainable development.

**2.4 EIA REGIME**

The EIA regime is to be assessed under the following three parameters as under:

a)                  Physical

b)                  Ecological

c)                  Socio-economic

**2.5 PURPOSE OF EIA**

The EIA serves one or  more of the following purposes:

a)                  Decision making

b)                  Choosing among various alternatives

c)                  Integrating environmental cost into project cost.

**2.6 STEPS**

The steps carried out in environmental impact assessment are as under:

a)                  Identification \\96 This involves assessing of the magnitude of impacts, geographical            extent, significance to decision makers etc.

b)                  Prediction \\96This  quantifies the impacts through mathematical models, physical   models, socio-cultural models, economic models and experiments.

c)                  Evaluation \\96  This predicts adverse impacts by comparing it with laws, regulations          or expected standards or by reference to present criteria or on the basis of    acceptance

to local community or public in general.        

a)                  Mitigation \-  Steps may be suggested for restoration of ecological balance.

b)                  Communication \\96 This involves communication of the results of EIA to the                     concerned agencies.     

**2.7 EIA PROCESS**

The EIA process comprises of the following:

**a)**            **Screening**

The screening can be either  project related or site related.  These are briefly described as under:

i)          _Project related_ \\96 This would determine the threshold value of cost, size and pollution levels

_ii)         Site related_ \\96 This is based on the assimilative capacity of the project area.  The following:

            factors are kept in view while carrying out site related screening

A)                Avoid environmentally sensitive areas

B)                 Avoid conflict with existing policies, plans & legislation.

C)                Avoid conflict with desirable land use e.g. prime agricultural land

**b)**           **Scoping**  

Scoping is carried out with the following objectives:

a)                  To determine depth of analysis

b)                  To formulate Terms of Reference

c)                  To identify _prima facie_ major/minor environmental issues involved

d)                  To determine geographical boundaries of the study

e)                  Gives  an idea about the  format for Environmental Impact Statement

**c)**            **Rapid and Comprehensive EIA**

The EIA can either be rapid or comprehensive as under:

i_)          Rapid EIA \\96_ This is the first level indication of the environmental issues of the readily

available data as utilised for this purpose.

ii)      _Comprehensive_ _EIA \\96_ This uses inputs from the rapid EIA.  Steps involved are: identification, prediction, evaluation of the possible environmental impacts.

**d)**           **Mitigative** **Measures**

It comprises of a strategy devised to prevent, reduce and compensate the impacts of the project.  The monetary  assessment of the mitigative measures is also  to be carried out to  include into the project cost.

**e)**            **Environmental Management Plan (EMP)**

This contains details of the management measures to be adopted. It narrates the key agencies/persons which would be responsible for the implementation of the plan.  It also includes Disaster Management Plan.

**f)**             **Environmental Impact Statement (EIS)**

It is a gist of the whole exercise for getting environmental clearance and also for information of the general public.

**g)**            **Post-Clearance Monitoring (PCM)**

This is carried with a view to ensure the effective implementation of the mitigative   measures.

**2.8 RESOURCES NEEDED FOR EIA**

The following resources are needed for carrying out the proper and effective environmental impact assessment**.**

i)          Qualified multi-disciplinary team

ii)                   Reliable data about the project and surrounding ecosystem(s)/ landscape

iii)                 Analytical instruments of International Standard Institutional arrangements

**2.9 METHODOLOGIES OF EIA**

#### Even though Davies and Muller (1984) have mentioned about one hundred methods for carrying out impact assessment, these can be grouped into the following seven general categories :

i)          Adhoc method

ii)         Checklist

iii)         Matrix

iv)        Network

v)         Overlays

vi)        Environmental Index

vii)        Cost Benefit Analysis

Each of the above methods is subjective to some extent, and none of these is applicable to every case. The selection of an appropriate method depends on the judgment and experience of the analyst.

**2.9.1 Adhoc method**

Broad areas of possible impacts are identified and the nature of the impacts is qualitatively grouped as given in the following steps:

i)          The area over which environmental impact is expected is identified.

ii)                   The nature of the expected impact is qualitatively categorised as follows:

\-                     positive effect/no effect/negative effect

\-                     beneficial/problematic/adverse

\-                     short-term/long-term and

\-                     reversible/irreversible.

A major advantage of the adhoc method is that it can be easily applied since it generally consists of statements of data requirements, without outlining the caused by a project \[the statement needs to be reframed\].  These methods should give a basic idea in determining the alternatives for the proposed project or for site selection .  However, they have several disadvantages, including:

\-                     no assurance of the identification of the comprehensive set of all relevant

impacts;

\-                     a  lack of consistency in analysis due to the lack of specific guidance, and

\-                     inefficiency  inherent in identifying and assembling a panel for each

impact assessment.

**2.9.2 Checklist**

Checklists identify environmental impacts of development activities on selected parameters.  There are four broad categories of checklists.  The simple checklist is merely a list of parameters and nature of impacts and does not provide guidance on how the environmental parameters are to be measured and interpreted.  The descriptive checklist  contains guidance on evaluation of the parameters.  The scaling checklist is similar to descriptive checklist, but with additional information on the subjective scaling of the parameters  Scaling\-weighting checklist is essentially similar to scaling checklist but with additional information on the subjective evaluation of each parameter.

A form of scaling-weighting checklist is the Environmental Evaluation System (EES) developed by Battelle Columbus Laboratories, USA.  It deserves a special mention since it was developed specifically for water resources projects.  From the list given by Battelle Columbus, 51 parameters are selected, which have been grouped under Ecology, Environmental Pollution, Human Interest and Physico\-chemical parameters.  EES is used to evaluate the predicted condition of environmental quality, both \\91with\\92 and \\91without\\92 the project.  The difference in Environmental Impact Units (EIU) between  these two conditions as read from  value function graphs are added up for arriving at the net impact of the project on environmental quality.

The simple checklist is still commonly used.  The use of this technique requires little technical and ecological data, but rather a general familiarity with the region and with the nature for the proposed development projects.  More complex checklists are used, but they require considerable resources and involve complex operational procedures (e.g. EES).

Limitations of this technique include the following:

\-         EIAs depend mainly on the experience and personal judgment of the experts   alone.

Bias can therefore occur.

\-  The cause-effect relationship between project activities and environmental            parameters cannot be identified.

**2.9.3**    **Matrix**

Leopold (1971)  /\\85..not in the list of references/ (now included)designed the first matrix used for impact assessment of water resources projects.  This method has served as the basis of many of the matrices which have been developed subsequently.  Matrix method can be considered to  be an extension to the use of checklist.  The rows of a matrix indicate impact areas, while the columns list out the project activities. There are various versions of the matrix method which assign magnitude to impacts, importance value to impacts, priority values to activities, relative weights to impacts and thus facilitate ranking of alternatives.

If the relative priority of developmental activity is determined, then the total value of a particular activity is the vertical sum of the column represented by that activity in the matrix multiplied by the priority value.  Finally the total value of interaction is the sum of all horizontal  values in the matrix.  The objective should be to minimise the total value of the interaction.  The procedure helps to identify major activities and to defined areas which need more attention and perhaps further study.

Matrices by themselves do not offer adequate criteria for decision-making; nor do they facilitate later monitoring of impacts.  Further, the matrix method assumes that all interactions and dependencies between components are of equal importance. An application of matrix method  described by Leopold  by Lohani & Thane (1980) to the Environmental Impact Evaluation Study is shown in Figure 1.

**2.9.1**    **Network**

The network method is an attempt to analyse the series of impacts that may be triggered by project activities.  A list of project activities is prepared to identify cause-condition relationships.  The approach is generally to define a set of possible impacts (from past experience of a particular project) and allow the users to identify likely impacts from the specific project being addressed.  Primary, secondary and tertiary impacts are identified.

The major strengths of the network approach are twofold: its ability to identify pathways by which both, direct and indirect environmental effects are produced, and its usefulness in the consideration of mitigating measures during the early stages of project planning.  The network effectively presents a display of factual information, but includes no mechanism for accommodating public input.

The network method may be best suited for single-project assessments, and is not recommended for large regional actions.  In the latter case the display may sometimes become so extensive that it may be of little practical value, especially when several alternatives need to be considered.

An example of the network methodology is shown in Figure 2

**Overlays**

This method relies on a set of maps depicting environmental characteristics (physical, ecological, aesthetic etc.)  of a project area.  A transparent overlay sheet is prepared as the base map, showing the location of the project and the boundaries of the area that has  to be considered for the assessment of impacts.  Transparent overlays are also prepared for each feature that is to be assessed.  The degree of impact of each feature can be shown by the intensity of shading taken from a specific black and white colour code.  The extent of an impact can be easily indicated by the area of the transparency that has been given a particular shading.,  A representation of the aggregate impact on different areas is shown by the relative intensity of the shading.

This simple method of visually representing individual impacts and combinations of impacts has a number of advantages.  For example, it is a good method for showing the spatial distribution of impacts, and is widely used when selecting a route for a new highway or electrical transmission line.

A number of disadvantages of manual overlays should also be noted.  Interpretation of more than 12 overlays at a time is often difficult and this means that only a limited number of impacts can be considered.  This constraint can be overcome by use of geographic information system (GIS) easily.

The overlay method is most useful in screening alternative project sites or routes preliminary to detailed impact analysis.  Overlays are a very useful \\93search\\94 mechanism for identifying the least environmental impact site or route of a linear project.

**2.9.2**    **Environmental Impact Index**

The method involves the estimation of an environmental index using factor analysis. Conceptually, it has not yet been possible to develop environmental indices which can be used for planning and management of water projects, except in a simplistic fashion.

**2.9.3**    **Cost-Benefit Analysis**

The ideal EIA methodology would be the one which accurately incorporates the environmental costs and benefits of a project within the conventional context of cost benefit analysis.  However, economic evaluation relies on the factor of measurement of the physical, chemical and biological aspects of development activities and then transforming them into monetary terms.  This technique strives to consolidate all effects into monetary terms, and the conclusions are expressed in terms of cost-benefit ratios.

The difficulty encountered in the use of this technique is, of course, that impacts have to be transformed and stated in explicit monetary terms and this is not always possible, especially for all environmental and social intangible factors.

The Cost-benefit analysis was initially developed for use in flood control projects in the United States in the 1930s.  Even though the technique has been significantly improved in recent years, it can handle environmental parameters in a very limited fashion.

**ENVIRONMENTAL CLEARANCE**

3.1 ENVIRONMENTAL CLEARANCE OF PROJECTS
=======================================

Observations reveal that each RVHP (River Valley & Hydroelectric Projects) i.e. ,hydroelectric or irrigation project brings broad range of impacts including alteration  in the habitats and species, diversity  of area, changes in land use pattern, aesthetics, natural and artificial resources and also affect upstream and downstream biology, hydrology and sociology. Although, water used in the RVHP  projects may be free, inexhaustible  and reusable natural resource but the same is not true for the environmental aspects . Environmental  aspects need to be scrutinized for the sustainable  development to mitigate the negative impact caused by  RVHP projects.

Since 1978, it  is an essentialadministrative requirement  for the mega projects  to obtain environmental clearance from the MoEF, Govt. of India. In order to assess the impact of the developmental projects/activities on the environment, the Ministry of Environment and forests (MoEF), Govt. of India issued a gazette notification on the EIA on January 27, 1994 and made environmental clearance statutory for all the projects located in ecologically sensitive/fragile areas as notified by the Government of India from time to time, besides 29 categories of the projects (later increased to 32)  as specified in the Schedule 1 of the Notification . These also include River Valley projects including hydel power, major irrigation, and their combination including flood control.

The above Notification was superceded by EIA Notification brought out by MoEF on the 14th September, 2006\. In this chapter, issues like statutory requirements for the environmental clearance, procedure for environmental clearance, time limit for clearance, single window  clearance, validity of the clearance letter, post-project monitoring, right of entry and inspection at the site, misrepresentation/manipulation  or concealment of data and requirement  of fresh clearance for the expansion/modernisation projects are discussed in detail. Environmental safeguards/conditions generally stipulated by the MoEF Govt. of India for the RVHP   are also mentioned.

###### 3.2 REQUIREMENTS FOR ENVIRONMENTAL CLEARANCE

It is mandatory that specified categories of RVHP projects viz. hydroelectric and irrigation projects obtain environmental clearance from the Government of India as per the  EIA Notification of 14th September, 2006, irrespective of the cost.  The complete Notification is enclosed at Annexure I. However, the important features are explained in the ensuing paragraphs.

(a)    a public hearing at the project site or in its close proximity \\96 district-wise to be carried out in the manner prescribed in Appendix IV for ascertaining concerns of the project affected persons;

(b)   obtain responses in writing from other concerned persons having a plausible stake in the environmental aspects of the project or activity and attempting to satisfy them through facts if some of the concerns are unfounded or due to incorrect assessment of the consequences of the project by them.

(iii)        the public hearing at, or in close proximity to, the site(s) in all cases shall be conducted by the State Pollution Control Board (SPCB) or the Union territory Pollution Control Committee (UTPCC) concerned in the specified manner which shall forward the proceedings to the regulatory authority concerned within 45 (forty five ) days of a request to the effect from the applicant.

**_IV.  Stage (4) -  Appraisal_**_:_

(i)     Appraisal means the detailed scrutiny by the Expert Appraisal Committee or State Level Expert Appraisal Committee of the application and other documents likeDPR, the Final EIA and EMPReport, outcome of the public consultations including public hearing proceedings, submitted by the applicant to the regulatory authority concerned for grant of environmental clearance. This appraisal shall be made by Expert Appraisal Committee or State Level Expert Appraisal Committee concerned in a transparent manner in a proceeding to which the applicant shall be invited for furnishing necessary clarifications in person or through an authorized representative. On conclusion of this proceeding, the Expert Appraisal Committee or State Level Expert Appraisal Committee concerned shall make categorical recommendations to the regulatory authority concerned either for grant of prior environmental clearance on stipulated terms and conditions, or rejection of the application for prior environmental clearance, together with reasons for the same. The EAC or the SEIAA, as is relevant, may also direct the applicant to re-do some of the components of the EIA study without changing the TOR or improve upon the EMP document if they are found wanting in certain respects.

(ii)    The appraisal of all projects or activities which are not required to undergo public consultation, or submit an Environment Impact Assessment report, shall be carried out on the basis of the prescribed application Form 1, any other relevant validated information available and the site visit wherever the same is considered as necessary by the Expert Appraisal Committee or State Level Expert Appraisal Committee concerned.

(iii)    The appraisal of an application shall be completed by the Expert Appraisal Committee or State Level Expert Appraisal Committee concerned within  60days of the receipt of the final Environment Impact Assessment report, Environmental Management Plan and other documents or the receipt of Form 1, where public consultation is not necessary and the recommendations of the Expert Appraisal Committee or State Level Expert Appraisal Committee shall be placed before the competent authority for a final decision within the next  15days .The prescribed procedure for appraisal is given in Appendix V ;-.

**3.3.6   Grant or Rejection of Prior Environmental Clearance (EC)**

(i)     The regulatory authority shall consider the recommendations of the EAC or SEAC concerned and convey its decision to the applicant within  45 days of the receipt of the recommendations of the Expert Appraisal Committee or State Level Expert Appraisal Committee concerned or in other words within one hundred and five days of the receipt of the final Environment Impact Assessment Report, and where Environment Impact Assessment is not required, within one hundred and five days of the receipt of the complete application with requisite documents, except as indicated otherwise in the Notification.

**3.3.7    Validity of Environmental Clearance (EC)**

The prior environmental clearance granted for a project or activity shall be valid for a period of ten years in the case of River Valley Projects (Item 1(c) of the Schedule).

**3.3.8      Post Environmental Clearance Monitoring**

(i)  It shall be mandatory for the project management to submit half-yearly compliance reports in respect of the stipulated prior environmental clearance terms and conditions in hard and soft copies to the regulatory authority concerned, on 1st June and 1st December of each calendar year.

(ii) Six Regional Offices of the MOEF located  at Lucknow, Chandigarh, Bhopal, Bhuvaneshwar, Shillong and Banglore have been assigned the job of post-clearance monitoring of all the cleared projects. All the recommendations/conditions stipulated by the Expert Committee (EC) have to be complied with by the project proponents. Submission of six monthly reports is mandatory after commissioning the project. Subject to the public interest, IAA can make "compliance report"  available to the public. Case of the non-compliance of the stipulated  environmental conditions/ recommendations of the cleared projects are brought to the notice of Ministry of Environment & Forests and Central/State Pollution Control Boards which initiate action against the project proponents under various legislations  promulgated by the Govt. of India.

(iii) A National Level Environmental Monitoring Committee has also been constituted by the Union Ministry  of Water Resources  to oversee the implementation of the environmental safeguards.  It is headed  by the Member (Water  Planning  & Projects ),  CWC  and comprises of members from the  Ministries of  Environment & Forests,  Agriculture , Welfare and Water Resources, besides Planning Commission. Chief Engineer ( EMO ), CWC is the Vice-Chairman of the Committee. It is assisted by State Level Environmental  Monitoring  Committees and  Project Level Environmental Management Committees.

**3.3.9**    **Operation of EIA Notification1994, till   disposal of pending cases**

            From the date of final publication of the EIA Notification of 14th September, 2006, the Notification dated 27th January, 1994 was superseded. The earlier Notification was allowed to be operative for some specified cases for a period of one year from the date of the new Notification viz  upto the 14th September, 2007. However, that period is now over and all the projects are required to be dealt with as per the new EIA Notification of 14th September, 2006.

**3.4     ENVIRONMENTAL SAFEGUARDS/CONDITIONS STIPULATED FOR RVHP          PROJECTS**

Following  are the general environmental safeguards /conditions stipulated by the Government . of India for implementation by the project proponents for maintaining the environmental and ecological balance in the concerned area:

(i)         Proper resettlement and rehabilitation of  the project affected persons.         

(ii)                Free fuel supply  to be provided  to the labour force at the  project cost.

(iii)               Restoration of construction area to be ensured  by levelling, filling of borrow pits and land escaping. Necessary soil conservation measures  during construction of roads.

            (iv)       Afforestation/compensatory afforestation.

(v)       Categorization of the sub-watersheds of the entire catchment contributing at the water storage/diversion site into various soil erosion classes following the Silt Yield Index (SYI) method of the All India Soil and Land Use Survey (AISLUS) and consider sub-watersheds falling under \\91very high\\92 and \\91high\\92 classes for developing catchment area treatment plan. The execution of the CAT plan at least over the directly raining catchment must be completed before filling up the reservoir or before water diversion starts, respectively, in the cases of reservoir and run-off-the-river schemes. The sub-watersheds under very high and high erosion categories that are outside the directly draining catchment may be brought under CAT in a phased manner within five years from the year when the reservoir is filled/water diversion starts, respectively, in reservoir/run-off-the-river schemes. The project budget may have adequate provision for planning and executing CAT activities.

            (vi)       Adequate  arrangement  to prevent incidence of any endemic  health problems due to water/soil borne diseases.

(vii)       Providing drinking water attracts Priority No. 1 under the National Water Policy (2002) of the Govt of India. In deference to this declared policy of the GoI and in view of the hardship faced by people in fetching safe drinking water, both in hills as well as in the plains, and also as a goodwill gesture to the community surrounding the project area, the applicant shall consider allocating certain amount of need based water from the water resource developed for the project for drinking water purpose. This will be in addition to the water allocated for drinking for the project staff, contractual work force, etc.

(viii)    A multidisciplinary Environmental Management Cell to be constituted  by the State Govt.  in consultation  with the MOEF with inclusion of experts  from the disciplines such as forestry, ecology, wildlife, social science  etc. to oversee  the effective  implementation  of suggested environmental  measures.

(ix)       Adequate and  separate budget for the environmental management, including Plans for Biodiversity Management, Fisheries Management, Wildlife Management, Conservation/Rehabilitaion of RET species, etc.

**3.5  Three** **Stage Clearance Process for River Valley Projects**

According to the revised procedure for clearance of irrigation, flood control and multipurpose projects which came into force from July 2002, the concerned project proponent in the initial stage, will first submit Preliminary Report covering surveys & investigations, international/interstate aspects, hydrology, irrigation planning, environmental aspects, intended benefits etc which are required to establish soundness of the project proposals. The project proposal will be examined and if found acceptable, the CWC shall convey \\91In Principle Consent\\92 for preparation of Detailed Project Report (DPR). Thereafter, DPR will be prepared with uptodate cost and simultaneously the project authorities will process and obtain necessary clearances of MOEF in respect of EIA and forest area diverted. If Scheduled Tribe population is affected, the clearance of R&R plans will be obtained from the Ministry of Tribal Affairs. The DPR thus prepared will be examined in CWC and project proposal will be put up to the Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) for clearance.

**3.6  Conformity** **of Provisions of Existing Regulations**

It is to be ensured that none of the activities planned by the project proponents during the investigations/construction/operational phase of the projects violates the provisions of the EIA Notifications, 2006; the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980; the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972; Environment Protection Act, 1986; and their subsequent amendments, Biological Diversity Act 2002  and other relevant Acts/Rules issued by the Central/State Government.

**3.7 Site selection requirement for River valley projects**

The details of site description on current land use pattern, inventorization/ characterization and population dynamics of flora and fauna in and around the proposed site with site map should be provided for alternative sites.  A brief justification is to be provided as to why a particular site has been chosen over other sites.

In addition to the techno-economic considerations, site selection must incorporate environmental considerations as well.  Some of the major environmental components that need to be kept in view during site selection includes:

\-                     Population/human settlement in the inundated and watershed area;

\-                     National Parks & wildlife sanctuary, breeding area/feeding ground / migratory route;

\-                     Ecologically sensitive areas like tropical forests, Biosphere Reserves, agriculture, fishery, recreation and coastal areas;

\-                     Sites and monuments of historical, cultural and religious significance; and

\-                     Land use types and land availability.

**3.8 Analysis of Alternatives**

Many of the possible alternatives concerning type, scale, location and dam types will be influenced by economic, technical or regulatory considerations and EIA should ensure that environmental criteria are added to this list.  Ideally, an EIA should be undertaken for the project and for all the feasible alternatives.  A thorough discussion of alternatives ensure that the developer has considered other approaches to the project and means of preventing damage to the environment. 

An outline of the alternatives studied by the developer and an indication of the reasons for selecting the proposed alternative should be submitted.  Consideration of alternatives is not a mandatory requirement for EIA and is left to the developer to decide if alternatives are relevant to their project.  It is, however, a good practice to consider alternatives during project planning, to examine their environmental impacts in deciding which alternative to choose and to report the appraisal of alternatives in EIA.

Alternatives are essentially different ways in which the developer can feasibly meet the project\\92s objectives, for example by carrying out a different type of action, choosing an alternative location or adopting a different technology or design for the project.  At the more detailed level, alternatives merge into mitigating measures where specific changes are made to the project design or to methods of construction or operation to avoid, reduce or remedy environmental effects.  All EIA systems also require developers to consider mitigation.

The consideration of alternatives is of major importance when EIA is taken up at an early stage of project cycle.  Depending upon timing, for hydroelectric projects  type and range of alternatives open to consideration might include:

o       Locations or routes

o       Dam type

o       Dam height

o       Design of structures

o       Types and sources of materials

o       Size of the site or facility.

The \\91no-action\\92   alternative refers to environmental conditions if the proposed project does not go ahead and essentially relates only to the discussion on the need for the project.  The consideration of alternatives locations/sites is essential in the planning of any project and the careful selection of a suitable site is fundamental to minimizing the environmental impacts of a project.

**4.7 ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT AND COST ESTIMATES**

With a knowledge of the baseline conditions, the ongoing construction activities, the planned future development programmes and current critical conditions, projections are to be made of their influence on physical, chemical and biological aspects of environment in the area. These projections should identify whether the pre-project critical environmental conditions will be further degraded and what additional environmental conditions are likely to become critical. An environmental management strategy will be developed to mitigate the adverse impacts. The strategy will include evaluation of alternative methods to reduce or eliminate adverse impacts of the most critical areas likely to contribute to the most significant environmental burdens. Cost estimates for each of the proposed mitigatory measure should be given.

**4.8 ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING**

The Environmental Impact Assessment is basically an evaluation of future events. It is necessary to continue monitoring certain parameters identified as critical by relevant authorities. This verifies the adequacy of Environmental Monitoring Plan and will anticipate any environmental problem so as to take plan and implement effective mitigative measures. It will also allow validation of many of the assumptions made in preparing this complex assessment. The consultant will design a post-project environmental monitoring programme for implementation, and then various parameters will be monitored by relevant departments. The cost estimates and equipment necessary for the implementation of this programme shall be included. Inclusion of the following indicators in such a programme may be considered :

**\-** water quality, in the main canal, in drainage channels, and in the reservoir; standard analysis

technique including the analysis of toxic residues from agro-chemicals;

\- fish growth of introduced fingerlings in the reservoir;

\- changes in ground water level and ground water quality.

\-  proper implementation of CAT plan

\-  proper implementation of afforestation

\-  earthquake monitoring (reservoir induced earthquake)

\-  pore water monitoring

\-  seepage water monitoring

**_CHAPTER 5_**

**GENERATINGBASELINE ENVIRONMENTAL  INFORMATION FOR THE PROJECT AREA**

The studies to generate baseline environmental status of river valley projects consist of a combination of desk studies (gathering existing documents, data sets, accumulating past lessons learned) and field surveys to address key issues outlined during scoping.

This manual includes the aspects to describe the baseline environmental status that are likely to be significantly affected by the river valley and hydro-electric projects.  The manual also describes methods to be used to generate baseline data.  However, data generation should be fine tuned based on site attributes at scoping stage.  The location, size and type of the proposed river valley project primarily influence the selection of parameters to be studied. It is a very important aspect and it is strongly recommended that a Plant Taxonomist should be included in the EIA team to take care of the relevant issues.

**5.1**         **Study Area**

The study area of the project extends from the directly draining catchment area up to dam /tailrace/canal and distributary system in the downstream.  While there are direct environmental impacts associated with the construction of the dam (e.g. dust, erosion, borrow and disposal problems), the greatest impacts result from the impoundment, flooding of land to form the reservoir and alteration of water flow downstream.  The direct impacts of  projects occur on soils, vegetation, wildlife, fisheries, water quality and especially the human population in the area as described earlier in Chapter 4.

Area of influence for the project should be variable for each environmental component and firmed up at scoping stage.  The following should be considered for describing area of influence.

\\B7        Directly draining catchment area at dam site for catchment area treatment plan and land environmental studies.

\\B7        Submergence, land diverted for project components including township, roads, borrow areas, land identified for R&R, muck disposal etc. for biological and socio-economic studies.

\\B7        Boundary of submergence u/s of dam site upto powerhouse site for water environment.

\\B7        10 km radius from project boundary (including submergence, dam site, powerhouse, tailrace, etc.) for identifying sensitive location.

**5.2 Description of the Project**

EIA should describe the purpose and objectives for the development.  The proposal and its need are to be placed in the context of locate/regional/national plans/objectives/strategies.  The anticipated time scales of construction, operation and (where appropriate) decommissioning of the proposal should be given.  The construction methods (techniques and equipments to be used) should be given.  The description should include its location, the design and size of the development and the area of land during construction and operation.  The description should be illustrated by the use of maps and/or diagrams.  EIA should provide reasonable estimates for the quantities and type of traffic that will arise during construction and operation.

The details on project profile should include type of dam, height of dam, gross storage capacity, direct draining catchment area, submergence area, gross and net head.  Similarly, details such as canal system, water training structure/weir, headrace, tailrace, spillway, canal/aqueduct/tunnel, penstock, fish ladder/lift/passage-way, administration and maintenance building, access roads and maintenance roads, construction and operational worker camps and township should also be provided in EIA Report.

The geographical locations of the dam and submergence area such as village, taluka, district, state, latitude and longitude should be mentioned.  The geographical extent of catchment area in terms of district and states should also be defined.   Total area of the project included that of submergence and project parameters should be incorporated in EIA report.  The break up of existing land use proposed to be diverted for various project parameters and submergence should also be given.

The details on construction methodology, construction material requirement, construction period, number and type of construction equipment should be provided.

**5.3     Environmental Setting**

The description of environmental setting should be provided in EIA report.  Though some details may overlap with the information required to establish baseline status of various environmental components, however, the details required at this stage may be quoted later in EIA report.

The description should be given for geology, drainage, seismicity and meteorology.

**5.3.1 Mineral bearing Sites:**

The creation of reservoir may lead to submergence of potential mineral bearing sites.  The mineral bearing sites should be identified and the details such as area of such reserves, indicated and proven quantities of minerals be given in EIA report.

**5.3.2**    **Sites of Archeological Importance**

**5.3.3**    **Fossil bearing sites\_\_--If plant and animal fossils are found in the project area and creation of reservoir may lead  to submergence of fossil bearing rocks, such sites should be identified and fossil flora and fauna studied in detail with the help of Birbal Sahini Inst of Palaeobotany and results included in the EIA report.**

The archaeological sites/monuments may get affected due to HE project particularly those having large reservoirs.  Details such as name, area, period of construction, age of construction and antiquity should be given in the report.

**5.3.4**    **Flood/ Cyclone/Drought/Cloud Bursts**

The frequencies of flood, cyclone and droughts are important considerations on which the data should be collected and presented in EIA report.  If a region is prone to flash flood, frequency of its occurrence, area and population affected should be determined.  If the region is susceptible to cyclone, frequency of occurrence of cyclone should also be determined.  The correlation of simultaneous occurrence of flash flood and cyclone should be established because such event shall give rise to maximum flood.

The highest flood that can be expected in a specified number of years (T-yr flood) is of importance in fixing the flood absorption capacity of the reservoir in deciding the capacity of the spillway, in estimating the land likely to be submerged, and in evaluating the likely flood moderation, on the downstream side.  Visual examination of the site and study of the topographical map will indicate the nature of the flood experience at the site (flash flood, slowly rising flood ,etc.).  The data to be collected are annual maximum floods (discharge and / or flood stages) that have occurred in the preceding years, and must be for as long a period as possible.  In case such data are not available for the site or at locations reasonably upstream or downstream of the site, data on highest recorded rainfalls, their intensities and duration must be compiled and flood hydrographs be made.  Most of such flood data required for environmental analysis would be available from technical feasibility study. 

The basic characteristic of drought is steady rise in temperature,  in addition to the severe deficiency of rainfall over a fairly long period.  Several factors, such as precipitation, temperature, wind velocity, sunshine, soil texture, soil moisture and antecedent rainfall interact to produce this situation.  However, a critical role is played by rainfall and the crucial factors are its distribution, variability and capacity to meet the evapo\-transpiration requirement.

Data on drought must include the following:  the rainfall deficit, the flow deficit, the duration and the frequency of droughts, the type of crops lost and frequency of occurrence of drought.

Cloud bursts are reported particularly in Himalayan region which result in flash flood in small rivulets and nallahas.  Frequency of such incidences in project region and consequent flooding in the adjoining rivulets/nallahs should be included in EIA report.

**land slidesThe** past records of land slides occurrence in the region should be scanned and data such as past events of landslides, area affected, frequency of occurrence per decade, geomorphological conditions, degree of susceptibility to mass movement should be provided.

**5.4**          **Construction Details**

**5.4.1**    **Construction Material**

A large quantity of construction material is required for HE project.  The procurement of the construction materials such as cement, stone, steel, sand etc may also cause significant environmental impacts.  The requirement (peak & average), inventory ( peak &average), source and mode of transportation of construction material should be presented in EIA report.

In case quarrying is to be carried out to procure construction material, the following details are required:

\\B7        Location

\\B7        Area

**5.5**             **Water Environment**

**5.5.1**    **Hydrology**

          Water available in the project catchment should be considered in terms of precipitation,       surface runoff, rivers, lakes and groundwater.  One of the most important analyses of any water development project is the quantity of water of required quality which could be made available in the project area for various uses, viz; drinking, irrigation, hydro-power, navigation and industry as HE projects are sometimes planned as multipurpose projects.

         The surface water  bodies such as rivers, lakes, reservoirs, tanks and ponds should be indicated on the map.  In addition to surface water, groundwater and conjunctive use of surface and groundwater should receive adequate attention.

         The data on groundwater can be obtained from maps published by the CGWB and their published data on recharge potential of various districts of India.  Additionally, whatever data the relevant state groundwater boards and water supply authorities may have collected should also be consulted.  For small basins and for areas where no groundwater data are available, information from local sources such as individual well-owners, should also be collected.

**5.5.2**                **Water Quality**

            Water quality refers to the physical and chemical  composition of water body.  Physical characteristics include temperature and presence of particulate matter; chemical conditions depend on the types and concentration of dissolved chemicals present.

             The reservoir frequently stratify during the summer into an upper layer (the epilimnion), which is well oxygenated, and a lower layer (the hypolimnion), which is isolated from the atmosphere and may suffer oxygen depletion.

             The water quality on the river proposed to be dammed should be monitored at dam site, 1 km downstream of dam site and water intake point for the township.  The parameters to be monitored to establish baseline status of water environment include pH, temperature, total dissolved solids, total suspended solids, turbidity, nutrients, DO, iron, manganese, zinc and bacteriolodical parameters like total coliform and fecal coliform.  These parameters have been chosen considering impacts particularly due to reservoir creation, scaling on turbine blades and drinking water requirements which can be finetuned depending upon project type and environmental setting.

          The methods of water sample collection and analysis, techniques and various standards are    presented in this National EIA Manual.

**5.6**   **LAND ENVIRONMENT**

The project may result in potential impacts on the land use such as agriculture, pasture and forest and result in conflicting land use (landuse/land cover maps to be prepared).  Moreover, landuse indirectly draining catchment alongwith physical characteristics of soil affect sediment transport to river and subsequently to reservoir, limiting its storage capacity and lifetime and robbing downstream waters of sediment.  The HE projects are accompanied by construction activity, creation of new settlements, diversion of forest areas and introduction of new development.  All these factors affect the soil cover resulting in compaction, increased sedimentation, , soil erosion,and loss of soilfertility and flash floods..

Therefore, study of land use pattern and physical characteristics of soil in the catchment area are important considerations in EIA of river valley & HE projects.

**5.6.1**    **Erosion and Siltation**

An initial appraisal of soil erosion and subsequent siltation needs to be carried out at this stage.  Composition of top soil, pattern of rills and gullies, land use, vegetation slope and rainfall patterns are all potential indicators of the extent of soil erosion.  The status of forest cover in the catchment should be carefully considered.  If deforestation is widespread in the river catchment, higher rate of siltation in the reservoir is anticipated.  The estimated rate of sedimentation could be based on observed rates in nearby similar projects.

The impacts of erosion and siltation should include:

\\B7        Assessment of erodibility, slope stability and scouring of the main soil types in the project area.  A map indicating erosion-prone areas should be prepared in developing the management plan for soil erosion and sediment control.

\\B7        Assessment of erosion and siltation rate in the project area and the expected rate of siltation in reservoir and canals,

A map indicating locations of temporary settlements of workers, borrow pits, sites for dumping construction wastes and waste products from workers\\92 camps, access roads, etc should be prepared.

**5.7 Biological Environment**

The baseline status of biological environment should be established by studying distribution pattern, community structure, population dynamics and species composition of flora and fauna belonging to all groups. Species diversity, richness indices should be calculated to establish the overall biodiversity richness.The RET, red listed species and faunal species belonging to schedule category of Act should be identified and enumerated/listed for conservation and rehabilitation,  A critical field survey and visit to study area shall record and report all the type of available species, supplemented by secondary data from Forest Working plans and other authentic published literature. The voucher specimen of all the species observed in the area, particularly the RET species,  should be collected, maintained and shown to the EAC during the presentation of EIA report.

**5.8 Noise Environment**

The assessment of impacts on noise environment is significant only during construction phase.  During pollution due to blasting and other construction associated activities should be considered.  Equivalent noise level (Leq) has gained wide spread acceptance as a scale for the measurement of long term noise exposure.  Hourly equivalent noise levels in the study area should be monitored during daytime and nighttime and compared with National Ambient Noise Quality Standards (NANQS).  The maximum distance of noise monitoring locations should be 2 km of project boundary or nearest habitation whichever is more.  The noise monitoring locations along the roads on which transportation is expected in construction phase should be restricted within 500 m of the road.  These monitoring locations should be in residential, commercial and silence zones.  Noise monitoring should be carried out once only during EIA study. 

**5.9**         **Air Environment**

Impacts on air environment are expected only during construction phase of HE project.  The pollutants likely to be emitted due to the construction activities are particulates and impacts will be limited to area close to project site.  Air quality monitoring should be restricted to project site and at downwind direction.  The air quality with respect to Suspended Particulate Matter (SPM) and Repairable Particulate Matter (RSPM) monitored for 7 days at each location should be monitored.

In case the study area is devoid of any air pollution source, there is no need of ambient air quality monitoring.

**5.10**        **Socio-economic Environment**

**5.10.1** **Demographic Profile**

                         The data on population in the project area should be collected with a view to ascertain the number of people and the extent to which they are beneficially and/or adversely affected.

The population data collected would provide the basis for analysing migration, immigration, population, projection, rehabilitation and resettlement, identification of beneficiaries, relative distribution of benefits and urban rural conflicts.

The population data can be collected from the available records at Municipalities, Block Development Officer, Village Panchayats, Local Self Government Officers, as well as from the latest available census report. District gazetteers are the major source of information.  If necessary, door to door sample surveys can be undertaken to review the quality of information available.

**5.10.2** **Public Health**

It is imperative that consideration be given to:

\\B7        New health problems or vector pattern that may arise due to changes in water velocities, temperature quality or other physical change factors caused by water impoundment.

\\B7        Adequate public health plans to create facilities for migrant influx.  Possibilities of disease aggravation or new public health problems introduced due to change in population density and distribution also need to be looked into.

\\B7        Measures to control contamination of surface and groundwater due to pesticides and fertilizers also need to be drawn up in advance.

The following activities are necessary in proximity of hydroelectric projects to ensure that appropriate vector control programmes can be planned and implemented:

i)                    Identification of prevalent vectors

ii)                   Assessment of alteration in such species and risk of transmission of vector borne diseases as a result of the project, arising mainly from urbanization and new bodies of water;

iii)                 Survey of (or access to the data on) prevalence of malaria and other water and vector borne diseases.

A checklist for public health is presented into the community, environment and health services.  The data so collected provides basis for ranking of these factors and concluding the assessment of health hazards, as low, moderate or high.  Local health service units (dispensary, hospital, etc.) are good sources of information.

**5.11**                **Tourism**

The site for a water resources project could also have a great potential for tourism.  Creation of a new lake and dam could enhance the potential of tourism. Planned and controlled tourism could improve the socio economic conditions of the area.

The data to be collected should include number of tourists visiting the region/expected, the infrastructure facilities such as transport, accommodation and communication in the project area and areas of tourist interest in the neighbourhood.  The data should also indicate items of likely interest to tourists such as religious monuments, cultural centres, etc. in the region.

            **5.12   BASE LINE DATA REQUIREMENTS**

 The performance of a project in the long run can well be judged by the degree of deviation from the initial figures for different environmental parameters, i.e., baseline data (basic data) of a project. From EIA angle, there are a number of important   basic data each composed of a number of environmental parameters. Many a times, a project proponent reports onlya few of them some of which fall short of requisite number of parameters, uses old scientific unit or different units for the same parameter, often reports wrong unit for some and so on. Ideally, there must be a particular set of basic data.

  In order to streamline these in a systematic manner to expedite the clearance process, here is given a list of baseline data in a tabular form along with the requisite number of parameters under each baseline, their scientific unit, standard reference to be followed along with the related email and website address and few explanatory note or remarks. EIA report for the project has to cover the relevant environmental components in respect of ambient air quality, inland surface water quality, ground water quality, waste water generation, sedimentation, noise during construction, noise after construction, soil of catchment area, soil of project area, soil of culturable command area, cropping pattern, crop yield, crop water requirement, irrigation intensity, catchment area, project area, meteorology, elevation and biodiversity of a project.

Definition of project area: It is the sum total of area (may it be agricultural, homestead, forest, grazing, fallow, Government. or private land including water bodies and marshy lands) required for the construction of dam, power house, switch yard and its minor components, canal works, township, colony and its approach roads including green belts, stores and workshop; for submergence, quarry, resettlement, muck disposal, water supply, explosive magazine depending on the type of project.

Water requirement of crop can be determined in two ways:

i) Direct method like ET, i.e., evapotranspiration from a crop fiel\-

   d consumptive use approach.

ii) Indirect method like FAO-

**PREDICTION OF IMPACTS**

Prediction of impacts is a process to forecast the future environmental conditions of the project.  While it is required to forecast future environmental conditions quantitatively, certain factors can only be determined qualitatively for many reasons.  In some instances even if quantification is possible, the degree of uncertainties associated with the prediction of many variables may often make prediction process of theoretical interests because of many inherent limitations and complex interrelationships.

Impacts of project activities can be predicted through many techniques like mathematical modeling, overlays/superimposition of activity, or comparison of impacts observed in similar type of projects elsewhere.  The environmental impacts of HE projects could include changes in land use, demographic pattern, soil erosion, water table, water quality, migration of fish, flora and fauna.  The techniques employed for predicting environmental impacts are given below:

**6.1** **Population Projection**

Population projection is an important consideration since human activities in the project area, in the final analysis, contribute to socio-economic and environmental changes.  It is thus necessary not only to consider population projection under normal circumstances but also to forecast immigration to the project area because of enhanced agricultural and other economic activities.

Standard methods such as Arithmetic Increase, Geometric Increase, Incremental Increase and  Decrease Rate of Increase should be adopted.

**6.2** **Meteorology**

Some local meteorological changes could occur close to reservoir.  Higher relative humidity could be observed due to increased evaporation from the reservoir.  There could also be a moderating effect on extreme temperatures, e.g., lower summer maximum and higher winter minimum.  However, magnitude of such changes is minor and localized in nature.

Evaporation during the summer months causes water loss.  Standard methods are available to estimate evaporation losses which should be adopted.

**6.3** **Stream Flow Regulation**

The data on annual maximum floods is used to predict T-yr flood through frequency analysis.  In case such data are not available, maximum design flood values can be derived by using unit hydrograph techniques.  Regional indices or envelope curves may be used in the absence of unit hydrograph.  Alternative synthetic hydrograph may be generated based on topographical features and rainfall of the catchment.  In the absence of detailed rainfall records, empirical formulae or rational method may be used.  For major dams, probable maximum flood also has to be estimated.  Based on design flood value and site details, the maximum water level can be fixed.  Backwater computations starting from the dam will yield new maximum flood level on the upstream side.

Due to the construction of dam and reservoir, there will be regulation of outflow.  The modified flows can be predicted using flood routing methods.

For the smooth operation of rehabilitation and resettlement programmes, backwater computation are required to correlate stage of construction with submergence level of villages.

The information so required can be obtained directly from the parallel technical analyses.

**6.3.1**    **Water Quality**

The water quality parameters to be predicted include DO, pH, TDS, temperature and coliform count.  Additional parameters like nutrients may also have to be predicted depending on site attributes.

Amongst all water quality parameters, best predictions can  be made for DO and BOD through mathematical models by using Streeter-Phelps equation.  Many other BOD-DO models have also been developed which may be referred to case to case basis.

The results of the analysis of river water quality must be compared with the surface water standards. The degree of suitability of water for various uses should be obtained from the above.

**6.3.2**    **Eutrophication**

 Eutrophication results from the excessive levels of nutrients (phosphorous and nitrogen compounds).  It may lead to excessive algal growth, including that of blue green algae, which are obnoxious.  Many mathematical models are available for prediction of eutrophication levels.  Most of the models consider lakes, natural or artificial, as mixed reactor.  Most models assume phosphorus as the limiting nutrient for impact prediction.  When nitrogen compounds are the limiting factor, blue-green algae, which can fix nitrogen from the atmosphere could be dominant.

After assessing eutrophication data on numerous lakes on the temperate zone, Vollenweider developed the equation which can be used for the purpose.

**6.4**         **DRAINAGE**

Backwater effect on the tributaries and drains joining the river on the u/s side of the dam should be computed.  Areas likely to have impeded drainage should be quantified and marked on the project map.

Introduction of irrigated agriculture in the project area (in case of multipurpose projects) would mean that adequate surface and subsurface drainage must be provided to ensure that water and salt balances can be maintained on a long term basis.  Thus, it is necessary to predict drainage conditions in the irrigated areas to prevent development of salinity and water logging.  The risk of water logging could be estimated taking into account the groundwater recharge.  The components leading to ground water recharge should be estimated.  These components are:

\\B7        Recharge from rainfall occurring in command area

\\B7        Seepage loss from main canals, branch canals and distributaries

\\B7        Deep percolation form reservoir and canal irrigated areas, and

\\B7        Lateral inflow/outflow of water from adjoining areas

Based on recharge and water balance, the rise in ground water table is estimated.  Based on the depth of water table below ground surface, the area could be classified in relation to water logging as mentioned in Table 6.1.

 **Table 6.1. Water logging classification**

**Depth of water table (m)**

**Category**

At the same time, it is recommended that pH, Electrical Conductivity and Exchangeable Sodium percentage shall be monitored to assess the prevalence, extent of soil salinity conditions.  Based on these, as mentioned in Table 6.2, the soil conditions could be classified as normal, saline, alkaline or saline-alkaline.

**6.5** **Changes in Land Use**

Prediction of impacts includes consideration of potential changes in land use of the project.  The land use pattern may change due to the following:

\\B7        Submergence of the land due to reservoir

\\B7        Lands lost due to the construction of canals, distributaries etc.

\\B7        Construction of structures such as dams, spillways, power stations, offices and human settlements

\\B7        Conversion of land under other uses to agricultural land

\\B7        Changes in cropping pattern due to introduction of irrigation and

\\B7        Rehabilitation and resettlement of project affected people and increased growth rate of population

Land use maps indicating the current land use patterns should be prepared on a scale of 1:50000 and areas under each major type of use should be determined.  Similar maps of future land utilization should also be prepared.  Overlaying of both the maps would indicate the changes in land use patterns for each category.  Remote sensing and Geographical information System(GIS) techniques should be adopted for the purpose.

**6.5.1** **Forest** **areas**

The total area of forest lost by sitinglocating ?  of the dam, reservoir and other structures can be estimated by superimposing the project layout maps on the land use maps.  The net resultant loss under each category of forest land should be estimated.  The loss of forest in terms of its biomass can be estimated on the basis of forest productivity as given in Table 6.3. 

**Table 6.3.** **Biomass production**

**Forest** **type**

**Canopy cover         %**

**Biomass tons/ha**

The total biomass loss (tons/ha can be estimated by the equation:

(A1  25.0) + (A2  45.0) +(A3  100.0)

Where, A1, A2are A3  are scrub, open and dense forest areas in ha respectively.  The species that may be lost in above areas should be documented under rare/endangered categories.  Any other species which may need special attention should also be noted.

**6.6     Fisheries**

From the baseline data, it should be possible to identify the migrating fish species as well as their migration routes upstream and downstream.  Since the hydraulic regime of a river is changed due to construction of a dam, a change in fish species could be expected therein.  This could be predicted by considering changes that have been observed in other similar project areas earlier.

The water bodies that could dry up due to reduced flow downstream should be identified.  The reduction in fish production from these water bodies and their impacts on opportunities should be estimated.  The newly constructed reservoir is likely to increase fish production in the area.  The rate of fish production from a reservoir should be estimated by comparing it with other similar reservoirs.  Alternatively, empirical formula could also be used.  One such equation is shown below.  It was developed by Henderson and Welcome by using the data from 31 water bodies in tropical regions.

Catch, kg/ha = 8.7489 MEI 0.3813, where

Morpho-Edaphic Index (MEI)  \=                      Conductivity  and Mean depth

The data observed in manmade reservoir indicate that fish catch to the extent of 100 to 800 kg/ha/year can be achieved.

**6.7** **SEISMICITY**

Seismicity of the project region  indicates seismic hazard potential.  The site geology and seismic status need to be presented in the report.

Bureau of Indian Standard has laid down the criteria for earthquake resistant design of  structures in IS:1893 (Part 1): 2002. It contains seismic zoning map dividing the entire country into four zones, viz., zones II, III, IV & V taking into account the seismo\-tectonic setup, observed/reported earthquake occurrences and resultant damage etc.  Clause 1 through Clause 6 of this standard provides general principles and design criteria for all types of structures.  It also includes detailed provision for building design.  Detailed design provision for  special structures, viz., liquid retaining tanks, bridges & retaining walls, industrial structures and dams & embankments, separate parts of this Code is being formulated. While for small & medium dams, seismic zoning map can be used, but for large dams, it is mandatory to have site specific seismo\-tectonic investigations and seismic design parameters studies.

A **National Committee for Seismic Design Parameters (NCSDP) for River Valley Projects** has been set up under the chairmanship of Member (D&R), CWC & ex-officio Additional Secretary to the Government of India and experts drawn from Ministry of Water Resources, Central Water Commission, Geological Survey of India, India Meteorological Department, National Geophysical Research Station, Indian Institute of Remote Sensing, Department of Earthquake Engineering, IIT Roorkee, Central Water and Power Research Station etc. With the involvement of experts from all relevant organizations, the NCSDP provides much needed institutional mechanism to ensure safe & economical design of dams and other appurtenant structures with appropriate seismic design parameters.

During the techno-economic examination of Detailed Project Report of a large dam, the project authorities are instructed to get seismic design parameters approved by the National Committee for Seismic Design Parameters (NCSDP) for River Valley Projects. For small & medium dams, general principles and design criteria (Clause 1 through Clause 6) for earthquake resistant design of IS 1893 (Part 1): 2002 can be used, and in that case, no recommendation from the National Committee is required.

The National Committee for Seismic Design Parameters (NCSDP) for River Valley Projects considers all these aspects keeping in view the safe design procedure for dams and suggests revision / modification in the site specific seismic study report, if so felt necessary. Once the site specific seismic study report is acceptable, the National Committee endorses its recommendations on seismic design parameters.   The recommended seismic design parameters used to be adopted for design of structures.

**6.8 DAM BREAK ANALYSIS**

Dam Break may be summarized as partial or catastrophic failure of a dam leading to uncontrolled release of water.  Such an event can have a major impact on the land and communities downstream of the failed structure.  A dam break may result in a flood wave up to several meters high travelling along a valley at quite high speed.  The impact of such a wave on developed areas can be sufficient to completely destroy infrastructure such as roads, railways and bridges and to demolish buildings, in addition to endangering several lives of people and livestock.  With such destructive force comes a tremendous loss of life & property, if advance warning and evacuation was not possible.  Additional features of such extreme flooding include movement of large amount of sediment (mud) and debris along with risk of distributing pollutants from any source such as chemical works or mines workings in the flood risk areas. 

The extreme nature of dam break floods means that flow conditions will far exceed the magnitude of most natural flood event. Under these conditions, flow will behave differently to conditions assumed for normal river flow modelling and additional areas will be inundated that are normally not considered.  This makes dam break modeling a separate study for the risk management and disaster management plan. 

Though there have been great advancement in design methodologies, failures of dams and water retaining structures continue to occur, though such instances are very rare. As public awareness of this potential hazard grows and tolerance of catastrophic environment impact and loss of life reduces, managing and minimizing the risk of individual structures is becoming an essential requirement rather than a management option.

The objective of dam break modeling or flood routing is to simulate the movement of dam break flood wave along valley or indeed any area downstream that would flood as a result of dam failure.  The key information required at any point of interest within this flood zone is generally:

\\B7        Time of first arrival of flood water

\\B7        Peak water level \\96 extent of inundation

\\B7        Time of peak water level

\\B7        Depth and velocity of flood water

\\B7        Duration of flooding.

The above information is provided by dam break modeling, which greatly facilitates preparation of Disaster Management Plan.

A Disaster Management Plan (DMP) or Emergency Action Plan (EAP) is a formal document that identifies potential emergency conditions at a dam and specifies preplanned actions to be followed to minimize property damage and loss of life. The DMP/EAP specifies actions the dam owner should take to moderate or alleviate the problems at the dam site as well as in the areas downstream of the dam. It contains procedures and information to assist the dam owner in issuing early warning and notification messages to responsible emergency management authorities, viz., District Magistrate / Collector, Armed forces, Paramilitary forces, Project Authorities and other Central/ State Agencies. It also contains inundation maps to show the emergency management authorities of the critical areas for necessary relief and rescue actions in case of an emergency.

**6.9         Noise**

The method presented in National EIA Guidance Manual should be used for predicting noise levels due to construction equipment and turbines.

**6.10**              **Impact Significance**

The impacts are evaluated for their significance, once the impacts have been identified and analysed.  Determination of significance begins early at the stage of screening and scoping and extends throughout the EIA process.  The impact significance should first be determined as \\93predicted\\94 basis and later on \\93residual impact\\94 basis.  The impact significance is jointly considered in terms of characteristics (magnitude, extent, duration etc.) and importance( or value) that is attached to resource consumption, environmental pollution or alternative uses which are forgone.  Impact evaluation is a complex and debatable exercise which hinges on fluid boundary  between facts and values, and between EIA and decision-making.

EIA guidelines related to impact significance fall into the following two categories:

*   Emission based, comprising standards for air, water, noise etc.
*   Environmental quality based, comprising significance criteria for valued ecosystem

The methods presented in EIA Guidance Manual should be referred to determine impact significance.  Apart from the above, cost-benefit analysis should be carried out to determine impact significance.

**6.10.1     Cost Benefit Analysis**

The economic feasibility of  projects should be subject to Cost-Benefit Analysis(CBA)

The cost of proposed mitigation measures to protect the environment must be included in the project costs.  Mitigation measures may include:

\\B7        Compensatory afforestation

\\B7        Restoration of land in construction areas by filling, grading etc. to prevent further erosion

\\B7        Control of aquatic weeds in submerged areas to provide improved habitat for aquatic life

\\B7        Measures to salvage and relocate monuments from inundated zones

\\B7        Enforcement of anti-poaching restrictions

\\B7        Measures to prevent forest fires, over-grazing etc.

\\B7        Establishment of fuel depots to meet fuel requirement of labour force for preventing indiscriminate felling of trees

\\B7        Public health measures to control spread of water and soil-borne diseases.

\\B7        Catchment area treatment/soil conservation measures

\\B7        Rehabilitation and resettlement of project affected persons

Methods employed for cost benefit analysis include pricing methods, valuation approaches, travel cost method, hedonic pricing method.  These can be used from standard references.

**_CHAPTER 7_**

**ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT PLAN**

**7.1 MANAGEMENT OF IMPACTS**

The beneficial and adverse impacts of river valley projects have been described earlier in chapter 2. The  management of some of the major  impacts is discussed hereafter.

**7.1.1 Resettlement and rehabilitation (R&R)**

As the sites of these projects are located mostly in remote and hilly terrain, the submergence involves flora and fauna in addition to affecting socially and economically backward people living in such areas. The resettlement & rehabilitation ( R&R) of these families is undoubtedly a very delicate and sensitive issue. It is essentially a human problem. By and large, people have a deep attachment to their land, tradition, culture and way of life and do not want to part with them. However, the water resources planners have been aware of these issues and various measures have been taken for R&R of the affected people, even in the earlier river valley projects.

Initially, the compensation was paid to the displaced persons mainly under the Land Acquisition Act of 1894 and the formal rehabilitation guidelines did not exist. Efforts made for resettlement of the displaced persons varied from state to state and project to project. There were no clear-cut guidelines for defining the project affected people (PAPs). Later, some of the State Governments started formulating policies for resettlement of PAPs within their jurisdiction.

Meanwhile, the construction of multi-purpose projects like Sardar Sarover and Tehri Dam attracted the attention of a large number of Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) both in India and abroad, mainly on the issue of R&R. There has been an adverse publicity regarding these projects, particularly relating to the problems in proper implementation of the resettlement and rehabilitation of PAPs. Considering the need for broad guidelines on R&R of  Project Affected Families (PAFs) and to help the State/Project authorities in formulating their policies, the Government of India  formulated the National Policy for R&R of Project Affected Families during February 2004  (later supercede by the Policy of  2006).

The objective of R&R is that the oustees should enjoy a better quality of life at the place of resettlement than that enjoyed by them at the original habitat. For this purpose, master plans should be drawn based on the State/Project R&R Policy. In the absence of any such policy, the work of R&R should be carried out according to the norms adopted for other nearby projects. However, in no case should the norms be less than those recommended by the National Policy.

There are many positive aspects noticed in the resettlement and rehabilitation of oustees. One such encouraging factor is the involvement of voluntary agencies or NGOs in this work in a constructive manner. In the Upper Krishna Project in Karnataka State, a reputed NGO, Maryada, was associated in preparing the Action Plan for the rehabilitation of PAPs. Similarly, in the Upper Indravati Project, in Orissa State, a voluntary agency viz. M/S Agragamy was entrusted with the work of preparation of rehabilitation master plan for the oustees. NGOs by adopting a constructive approach can play an important role in proper rehabilitation & resettlement of displaced persons.

**7.1.2**    **Submergence of forests : Compensatory afforestation**

The country is reported to be losing forest cover at an alarming rate of 1.5 million ha per year. However, it needs to be stressed that the deforestation on account of water resources projects has been limited to only 4% of the total forest that has been lost during the last threedecades. Against this loss the water resources projects have created biomass including tree crops & other plantations several times over the forest lost. Availability of electricity from hydro-power projects, in fact, checks demand of fuel and fire wood that greatly contribute to deforestation. Nevertheless, compensatory forestry has become an essential and integral part of all the new water resources projects. In several large projects like Narmada Sagar and Sardar Sarovar Projects, alternative lands for compensatory afforestation have been allocated and the cost of this has been included as part of the project cost. Considering the importance of forestry, the environmental safeguard pertaining to compensatory afforestation is next in importance only to rehabilitation.

The tree species selected for planting should be multipurpose and indigenous and no exotics should be planted. RET species found in the submergence area should also be included in the plan.

The Department of Environment of the Government of India has issued detailed guidelines for the diversion of forest land for non-forest uses.

**7.1.3 Water-logging**

Water logging is generally projected as a major negative environmental impact of the water resources projects. Apprehensions have often been expressed that canal irrigation leads to severe water logging and soil salinity in the command areas of large number of projects. Water logging results from the excess moisture due to frequent flooding of the irrigated land, overflow of runoff, seepage from canal, over-irrigation, artesian water and impeded subsurface drainage conditions. Number of statistics are paraded in respect of water logging which are of questionable magnitude and relevance. Quite often the statistics that are cited are for the entire land area suffering from water logging and salinity without any categorization  of the area affected due to canal irrigation and due to other natural causes. In flat areas receiving high rainfall, lot of land is water-logged during rainy season even without irrigation water. The problem in this area is further aggravated by the construction of roads and railways with poor provision for cross drainage.

Water logging is not new to the Indian water resources planners. This was faced in some of the older projects like the Western Yamuna Canal and the Eastern Yamuna Canal. Western Yamuna Canal which was constructed in the 14th century faced water logging problem as no checks were imposed on irrigation and due to inadequate cross drainage works. This canal was remodeled in 1873 and the alignment was improved and drainage works introduced. These measures resulted in significant improvements and reclaiming of land. The canal remains in service even today. Number of Acts were also enacted in the past for providing drainage and anti-waterlogging measures.

It is true that in the recent years, some of the projects faced water logging  conditions but the area of land waterlogged is generally small as compared to the irrigated area.

**7.1.4 Sedimentation**

Sediment flow in rivers is a natural process and water resources development projects do not contribute to increase in the sediment inflow in the rivers. Provision is kept in all reservoirs in the form of dead storage for trapping of sediments. It is a fact that in some of the projects constructed earlier the rate of inflow of sediments have been observed to be more than the anticipated values. This may be due to the empirical relationships used for assessment of the silt load in the absence of adequate observed silt data. Now, with the advent of modern technology and equipment, rate of siltation can be estimated more accurately. Further, remedial steps to reduce the sediment flow in rivers such as soil conservation and watershed treatment have been taken up in a number of catchment areas of various projects.

**7.1.5 Flora and fauna \\96 Biodiversity and Wildlife Management plans ??**

In case some unique or endangered species of flora and fauna are likely to be threatened by the project, suitable measures are required to be taken for their rehabilitation. Similarly, if the project interferes with wild life migration, suitable arrangements are to be made for their habitat.

In fact, protection of flora is a contentious issue. Merits and demerits of a reservoir with reference to loss of flora have been debated extensively but no standard solutions have been arrived at. An extremely rare step for environmental protection would be to abandon a project, if it endangers rare species of plants or animals, in order to preserve the natural heritage. However, as the project submerges only a small fraction of forest land, it is difficult to comprehend that the particular endangered species of plants or animals cannot be preserved in the vicinity of the project in the same watershed. Gene banks to preserve  species and to regenerate them in favorable conditions elsewhere, is very much possible. Silent Valley project in Kerala, though a promising project planned to develop hydro-power, was shelved, as it was projected as affecting prime virgin forest with rare species of plants. The submergence of wildlife can be taken care of by relocating the sanctuaries at suitable places and by carrying out wildlife rescue operations as was done at Dudhganga reservoir (Maharashtra). The positive aspect of water resources development is the assured water supply for wildlife in all the seasons. After construction of Heran reservoir in Gujarat, population of wildlife has shown a trend of increase and crocodiles which were on verge of extinction are now abundant in the reservoir. Periyar wild life sanctuary on fringes of Idukki lake and Sloth Bear sanctuary proposed at Sardar Sarovar Project are some the examples of steps to protect the wild life. Pong reservoir is now acting as a resting place for migratory birds and number of rare species of birds have now been sighted in these areas. Water reservoir projects have in general enhanced the natural environment for development of flora & fauna in its vicinity.

**7.1.6 Mineral Deposits and Historical Monuments**

At times mineral deposits, archaeological monuments or shrines are threatened by submergence due to reservoirs. It is possible to protect the mineral wealth and monuments falling in the shoreline zones by constructing ring bunds etc. or even by exploiting the resources to the possible extent before inundation.

Due to the construction of Nagarjunasagar dam on the river Krishna in Andhra Pradesh, valuable historical monuments were to come under submergence. These were excavated well before impoundment and shifted to a museum on the top of a nearby hill coming within the reservoir . Similarly, Dargah at Galiakot which would have come under submergence of Kadana reservoir on the river Mahi in Gujarat, was protected from submergence by constructing a ring bund. Srisailam and Narayanpur reservoirs are other examples where historical monuments have been rehabilitated successfully. In Singur project of Andhra Pradesh, the Archaeological Department shifted the stone sculptures from different villages of submergence to a safe place.        

**7.1.7 Fish/Aquatic Life**

One of the criticism levelled against the water resources projects is that dams pose barriers across the rivers to affect the migration of fish species like salmon and trout. The provision of fish ladders has successfully taken care of these problems in number of projects such as Farakka, Kosi and Hathnikund barrages. The reduction in the river fisheries can be compensated by rearing fish in the reservoirs. Many new species have taken firm hold in the newly created environment. The striking examples in this regard are fast growing gangetic carp in the reservoirs of Krishna and Cauvery in the peninsular India and in the Gobind Sagar in north west Himalayan region. Ukai project can be cited as an instance of improvement of fish production where no commercial fisheries existed in the river before impoundment. Now two fish farms with breeding, hatching and spawning units, artificially controlled climatic and physio\-chemical conditions, have been established with encouraging results.

**7.1.8**    **Health Aspects**

Water related disease, such as Malaria, Typhoid, Diarrhea and Filariasis can  spread through unsanitary or  stagnant or slow moving water.

Surveys in selected irrigated commands also reveal that there is a general decline in incidence of diseases in these areas. Firstly, the very availability of water has led to improvement in level of sanitation. Secondly, the improved economic status has made people health conscious and capable of availing requisite health care. Vectoral risks can be substantially reduced by removing sources of stagnant or slow moving water and by ensuring sustained maintenance of drains and canals and efficient water management.

**7.1.9**    **Reservoir** **Triggered Seismicity/ Reservoir Triggered Earthquake (RTS/RTE)**

RTS/RTE represents the maximum level of ground motion capable of being triggered at the dam site by filling, drawdown, or the presence of the reservoir. It is incredible that huge amounts of energy, corresponding to high magnitude earthquakes, can be released as a consequence of small changes in the state of stresses at seismogenic depths, due to impounding. At the same time, earthquake can get triggered if ongoing tectonic processes have already caused conditions near to failure. The maximum magnitude and maximum surface intensity of seismic events cannot be increased through effects of reservoir impounding, in relation to purely tectonically caused events. Thus, if the determination of the controlling design earthquake is based on sufficient data and pertinent analyses, the risk caused by RTS/RTE phenomena is automatically covered. Thus, the RTS/RTE effect is automatically gets covered in Maximum Credible Earthquake (MCE) condition.

**7.1.10** **Water Quality**

Integrated development of water resources invariably involves planning the projects for diverse uses. Therefore, the preservation of water quality becomes a very important factor in the planning of multipurpose water resources projects. For this purpose, pollution of the river courses from industrial and municipal effluents will have to be controlled. In the context of water quality, significant problem is eutrophication which results from the excessive levels of nutrients in municipal, industrial and irrigation drainage effluents. Strong legal and administrative measures are required to ensure that the industrial and municipal waste waters are treated to an acceptable standard before being discharged into the rivers. Emphasis has to shift to non-chemical organic fertilisers in irrigated agriculture.

**7.1.11** **Minimum Flows in the River**

A dam or a barrage across a river stores and diverts substantial part of the river flow towards the target, which may be the turbines in a hydroelectric project or the command area in an irrigation project. As a result, the river reach immediately below the dam is deprived of natural river flow for varying lengths, till the discharge from the tail race tunnel of the hydroelectric project joins the river, which may be from a few kilometers to tens of kilometers from the point of diversion. In the case of irrigation projects, the water does not come back to the river, as it is used consumptively over the command area.

Currently, to maintain the ecological water need, 10 to 15 per cent of the minimum lean season flow is assured for release from the dam all the time by the project authorities. This has been questioned several times in the past. It has been found that in some cases, this 10 to 15 per cent of the lean season flow works out even less than a cumec, which may only be trickling through the river bed. For fish to live and migrate for food and spawning, even a few meters of river stretch experiencing such low flows is detrimental. The minimum release, therefore, ought to be worked out based on a scientific study on ecological water need and such a release is to be maintained in a time continuous manner throughout the days of the year. The aquatic fauna, particularly the fish, require a certain minimum flow depth and velocity in continuity in the river stretch to thrive and hence to migrate for food and spawning. Fixing a minimum water release in terms of the percentage of flow may not satisfy this requirement due to varying cross section and bed slope in different rivers. Hence, to decide the exact flow requirement for maintaining the aquatic environment a scientific study on ecological water need to be done.

 **Impact on Climate**

Water resources projects do have an impact on the climate in their vicinity. Irrigation increases the moisture content in the surrounding air, leading to a slight increase in the humidity but decrease in temperature due to evaporation from irrigated area. However, these impacts are not very significant. 

**7.1.12** **Tourism and Sports**

Development of gardens and recreation areas have taken place around many reservoirs making the environment more pleasant and providing recreational facilities to the people. Some examples are Brindavan Gardens (Krishnarajsagar) and Sant Dyaneswar Udyan (Jayakwadi). Government of Gujarat has developed area around Ukai reservoir as a tourist spot. Similarly, a nice garden has been developed around Ravisankar dam in Madhya Pradesh. The forests around reservoir created by Periyar dam is a very popular tourist spot where people can see varieties of wildlife while boating in the reservoir. Reservoirs can be developed into tourist attractions for skiing and fishing and to provide cheap and pleasant recreational facilities.

7.2         FORMULATION OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT PLANS

Delineation of environmental management plan requires maximizing the positive environmental impacts and minimizing the negative ones.  The measures could consist of modifications  of plans, engineering designs, construction schedules and techniques, as well as operation and management.

A judicious sequencing of construction operations and appropriate location of labour camp and project colony etc. can go a long way to reduce environmental damage.  The following factors are worth considering:

(i)         All road, construction and blasting operation(s), especially upstream of the reservoir, should be completed before reservoir filling is commenced so as to reduce excessive sedimentation load.

(ii)        Excessive blasting resorted to by the contractors should be controlled, especially in hilly terrain, so as to check the incidence of land slides in the area;

(iii)       Temporary labour camps must be located, to the extent possible, in areas which will later be submerged so as to reduce the loss of forest cover.  Even though the sites for resettlement and project colonies are selected well in advance, there should be no need to cut all the trees on these sites.  Only those trees should be cut which stand on the residential plots or on the proposed roads and paths.  Cutting of these trees should be taken up only when construction operations are imminent

iv)        The extent of clearance under the transmission lines should be related to the height of the standing trees and the clearance restricted to minimum necessary width.

v)         Vegetation on island formation in the reservoir above FRL should not be removed so that they may be developed as bird sanctuaries at a later stage.

Following environmental management plans for river valley and HE projects should be   prepared:

\-                     Catchment Area Treatment

\-                     Ecological Conservation and Management Plan

\-                     Muck Disposal Plan

\-                     Compensatory Afforestation Plan

\-                     Biodiversity  conservation and management plan

\-                     Conservation and Rehabilitation plan for RET species, medicinal plants, orchids

\-                     Landscape and Restoration Plan

\-                     Greenbelt Development Plan

\-                     Fisheries Conservation and Management Plan

\-                     Resettlement and Rehabilitation Plan

\-                     Human Health Management Plan

The guidelines to prepare the above mentioned environmental plans are described below:

**7.2.1**    **Catchment** **Area Treatment Plan**

The CAT Plan targets towards overall improvement in the environmental conditions of the region and should be limited to directly draining catchment.  The relevant CWC guidelines should be referred for this purpose.   All the activities are aimed at treating the degraded and potential areas of severe soil erosion.  The Plan provides benefits due to biological and engineering measures, and its utility in maintaining the ecosystem health.  The plan addresses issues such as prevention of gully erosion, enhancing the forest cover for increasing soil water holding capacity and arresting total sediment flow in the reservoir and flowing waters.

The CAT plan should comprise details on field investigations, identification of biological and engineering control measures for sediment arrest, infrastructure requirements, manpower requirements, feasibility of implementation, development of administrative guidance for identifying and determining feasibility of such activities.

Delineation of monitoring mechanisms for implementation of CAT plans, institutional analysis for orienting activities within existing administrative set up of implementing agencies, mode of payment schedule and appraisal of plans should also be covered in the CAT Plan.

**7.2.1.1 Methodology**

The methodology for undertaking CAT plan for HE project is presented below in figure 3. Geographical Information System (GIS) and data base management system are extensively used in preparation of CAT plan ( figure 4 ).

**7.2.1.2**               **Physiography****, River Basin Studies and Thematic Mapping**

The drainage basin (directly draining catchment) should be clearly demarcated and its area and extent, administrative and physiographic boundaries and features should be delineated.

The topography of the region should be studied with respect to features viz; soil types, landuse, slope types, forest types, agriculture settlements etc.

The slope classification and preparation of slope should be undertaken.  Mapping of habitats/settlements, settlement patterns, access to road, amenities, administrative boundaries and nearness to project features should be done.

Landuse/Land cover classification as discussed earlier using satellite data.

Soil types and mapping should be carried out using classification of All India Soil Survey & Land Use Planning (AISS&LUP), Nagpur.

Delineation of sub watersheds mini-watersheds, and micro-watersheds, their locations and extent based on AISS&LUP Watersheds Atlas on 1:50000 scale should be carried out.

**7.2.1.3**               **Soil Erosion Intensity Mapping**

Soil erosion intensity mapping through superimposition of various maps viz soil, slope, land use should be carried out and potential degraded areas should be identified.

Sediment yield index (SYI) as per AISS&LUP methodology should be determined.

**7.2.1.4**               **CAT Plan (Physical Aspects)**

As mentioned earlier, degraded/degradable areas in directly draining catchment through erosion intensity maps and their areas and extent should be identified in each mini watershed.

Suitable engineering and biological measures for treatment of potential degraded areas in each mini-watershed should be identified.

Suitable measures for treatment of degraded area depending upon feasibility of implementation based on slope, relevance and effectiveness.

Administrative guidance for identification and feasibility of implementation of these measures should be delineated.

**7.2.1.5**               **CAT Plan \\96 Cost Aspects and Implementation**

**7.4.6 Prioritization for Catchment Area Treatment**

A catchment area is treated by various conservation measures to reduce soil erosion due to the effect of rainfall and runoff.  Erosion -prone catchment, if left untreated,  causes unchecked soil erosion and consequent sediment into the downstream reservoirs, reducing their effective life.

Prioritization is necessary as the entire catchment cannot be treated with soil conservation measures due to financial and logistic limitations and it is also not necessary to do so.  Priority catchments are those from which the sediment outflow (a part of which finds its way into the reservoir) is high.  Adoption of a proper mix of various erosion control (soil conservation) measures in \\93very high\\94 priority catchments can reduce the reservoir sedimentation rate to the extent of 60 to 80 percent.  The sedimentation hazard from a catchment can be measured and can also be estimated.

**7.4.6.1 Measurement of Soil Erosion/Sedimentation**

Some of the River Valley Projects maintain silt Observation Posts (SOP) or Sediment Monitoring stations (SMS) at suitable locations of the major natural streams.  The sediment concentration in the runoff water is determined by sampling.  The sampling result, integrated over a time (say a year) gives the annual sediment production rate (SPR).  It is usually expressed in volume of sediment flown past the sampling point per unit catchment area per unit time.  It may also be converted to mass flow rate of sediment by determining or assuming a reasonable value of mass density of the sediment (a representative value may6 be 1.6 g/cm**3**, on dry mass basis).  The SPR from a catchment and the sediment deposition rate in the reservoir may vary considerably.  The SPR can, nevertheless, be a  very useful information to check if the actual sediment production rate and its assumed value at the design stage more or less tally.  However, in some catchments in India, it has been found that the actual rates were considerable higher than the assumed rates.  Such measurements immediately prompt for taking suitable soil conservation measures in the catchments.

The actual rate of sedimentation in a reservoir can be measured by grid survey of the reservoir base after draining off the water or by sounding method.  This is usually done at an interval of 5 to 10 years and the result gives the average rate of sedimentation over the preceding years.  This information is also useful for taking corrective measures if the reservoir sedimentation rate is found higher than the assumed value at the design stage.

The first of the above two methods can be adopted even during the project planning stage.  The latter is an after-project activity.  Both are useful in deciding whether a certain catchment needs soil conservation measures.

**7.4.6.2 Estimation of Soil Erosion/Sedimentation**

**_7.4.6.2.1  Universal_** **_Soil Loss Equation_**

This is a very old (1973)  approach to estimate annual soil loss from a catchment.  The fundamental works were done on small runoff plots and the method involves using many qualitative attributes of the catchment to ascertain its erosion behavior and is subject to judgement error as well as the diversity in the perception of the analyst.  It is not known if this method has ever been used in prioritizing catchments for treatment in the river valley projects in India.

**_7.4.6.2.2  Sediment_** **_(Silt) Yield Index (SYI)_**

SYI is calculated using an empirical formula.  Based on the numerical value of SYI, catchments are categorized into five priority classes from Very High (SYI>1300) priority to Very Low (SYI<1000) priority.  The method was proposed by all India Soil Survey and Land Use Planning (AISSLUP) based on  several studies**.**  The method has been used to prioritize catchments in India totaling in area of millions of hectares.  It is reported  that SYI procedure is fairly reliable for determining priority watersheds.  The empiricism in this method is manifest in the selection of unit area (mapping unit) and assigning an appropriate value of delivery ratio to it. 

**_7.4.6.2.3  Modelling_**  **_for Soil Erosion (Soil Loss) Prediction_**

There are several hydrologic models such as AGNPS (A Agricultural Non-Point Source), SWAT(Soil Water Assessment Tool), EPIC (Erosion Productivity Impact Calculator), WEPP (Water Erosion Prediction project), CREAMS (Chemical, Runoff and Erosion from Agricultural Management Systems), ANSWERS (Areal Non-Point Source Watershed Environment Response Simulation), SWRRB (Simulator for Water Resources in Rural Basin) and so on.  These models, among other things, also predict the soil erosion.  Most of these are highly demanding in the data requirement to operate them (eg. climatic, hydrological, plant growth, soil, irrigation, erosion, groundwater, pesticide application information, etc.).  These models are based on sound scientific principles and established mathematical representation of the various watershed physical processes.  The availability of the above models and the expertise in using them are limited to only a few institutions. To gain confidence on the model output for its use in catchment treatment prioritisation  and planning, it is necessary to have observed data to permit evaluation of the model result and for calibrating the model.

**7.4.6.3 Conclusion**

Quantifying soil erosion and reservoir sedimentation is necessary for prioritizing catchments for treatment and development of a suitable treatment mix.  It is, therefore, also required that the effect of various treatments on controlling soil erosion are quantitatively known.  River gauging data are the best information source for undertaking the above activities.  Where such data are not available, estimation procedures are to be adopted.  At the present level of data availability and also based on the past experience, SYI appears to be an acceptable parameter for use in catchment prioritization work.  The appropriateness of this parameter needs to be evaluated in different catchments through actual survey of the sediment deposition in the reservoirs.  Bases on this, the method may be updated/modified to use it with a greater confidence.

**7.9**         **Dam Break Analysis and Disaster Management Plan.**

The dam break analysis has two objectives viz; (i) assessment of hazard potential of the dam break and ii) to provide an approach to Disaster Management Plan

In order to assess the hazard potential of the dam, a Maximum Credible Failure(MCF) scenario is required to be visualized.  The MCF scenario considered for the study is a 100-year flood coupled with a dam break, as suggested by CWC guidelines.  The scenario should be given as an input to any dam break software, by which the flood/channel routing studies are carried out.  The maximum water level that would be attained at various points on the downstream in case of dam break should be marked on a detailed contour  plan of the downstream in case of dam break should be marked on a detailed contour plan of the downstream area to obtain the extent of inundation.  The available contour map should have resolution lesser than increment in water levels due to dam break so that the inundation  map could be prepared.

An assessment of the consequences of a dam failure on downstream areas is required and should include the following:

\\B7        An estimation of the magnitude of the dam break flood hydrographs resulting from hypothetical dam failure occurring with the reservoir at normal storage elevation and maximum storage elevation.

\\B7        A general description of the areas d/s that could be affected by flood water from a dam failure.

\\B7        Delineation of an inundation map delineating the maximum areal extent of flooding that could be produced by a dam failure.  Inundation mapping should extend to a point d/s where the dam break flood would no longer pose a risk to life.  This is often interpreted to be coincident with the point where inundation from the dam failure is within the 100 year floodplain for the affected watercourse.

The approach to Disaster Management Plan should delineate the needed organization for emergency response, outlines system of emergency preparedness consisting of emergency control centre, warning and communication systems and procedures of emergency preparedness.

In general, the DMP should describe procedures for responding to unusual or emergency situations and procedures for initiation of notification or warming of individuals who may be at risk in downstream areas.  As a minimum, the EAP should include the following:

\\B7        Notification procedures (preferably in the form of a flow chart) and responsibilities for notifying d/s residents in the event of an impending dam failure

\\B7        A notification list that include the names and telephone number of all affected d/s residents, dam owner and operator, local emergency official, and appropriate government agencies (including the dam safety office)

\\B7        Specific instructions for responsible parties to be followed at the dam site in response to emergencies such as floods, equipment failures, or other unusual events where the situation is evolving slow enough that immediate remedial action can be effective to prevent failure.

\\B7        Procedures to follow for emergency situations which probably would not lead to dam failure, but still could represent a hazard for downstream residents.
